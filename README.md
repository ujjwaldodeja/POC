This is a demo application to display the working of the Authorization server. Please follow the steps below to run this application:

1. Download the zip file or clone the project to a local repository

2. Navigate to the my-new-app directory of the project.

3. If you do not have react installed to your device or haven't worked with it, please go through this link 'https://react.dev/learn/installation'.

3. Use the terminal command 'npm install react-router-dom react-oauth2-code-pkce' to download the required libraries.

4. Before starting the application, please start the authorization server. Once the server is runnning, you can run the app using the command 'npm start'. This will open the React application in the your browser. 

5. At the homepage of this application, press the button 'Login with OAuth2' to authenticate, this will redirect the application to the loginPage of the SSO provider. In case the page is not redirectd, try refreshing the webpage which should lead to the loginPage of the SSO.
